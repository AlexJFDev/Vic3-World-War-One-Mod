 france_events.5.f:0 "The leftist representative has been murdered by Raoul Villain, a far-right extremist, at 9pm at the Restaurant Le café du Croissant. He was known for his defense of Alfred Dreyfus, the creation of the daily newspaper l'Humanité, his advocation for the workers' rights and his staunch pacifism. His recent calls for peace lead him to be the target of Villain. The death of this great figure will very probably create a void among french leftist movements."
