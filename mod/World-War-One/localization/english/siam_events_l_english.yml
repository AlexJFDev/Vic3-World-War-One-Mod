 siam_events.5.d:0 "A modern redesign of our flag has been proposed."
 siam_events.5.f:0 "The new flag, inspired by western designs, consists of five horizontal stripes of red for the land and people, white for the religions, and blue for the monarchy. Officially the first flag was created in 1855 by Rama IV, showing a white elephant on red ground, as the traditionnal plain red coloured flag was not distinct enough for international relations. Many among the kingdom are still attached to this traditionnal, but many politicians believe it is time that Siam shows a new face to the world."
 siam_events.5.a:0 "Let's adopt the new design."
 siam_events.5.b:0 "There is no need for such change."
