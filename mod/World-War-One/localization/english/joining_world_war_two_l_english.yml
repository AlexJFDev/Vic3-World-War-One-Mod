 je_joining_world_war_two_reason:0 "A war of unseen scale is raging in Europe. Even though it's taking a tremendous amount of lives, some members of our political scene and population are supporting different sides. If we decide to remain neutral, it will avoid us a waste of money and lives, but we will miss the potential momentum of a victory. If we decide to join one side, we have to convincing our people and elites, alongside redirecting our diplomatic stances. Mainly we have to establish trade and investment agreements, sign military alliances with members of one side. Political lobbies and war participants that have rivalries with us will also impact our progress. Once the support for one side has been consolidated, we can join it."
