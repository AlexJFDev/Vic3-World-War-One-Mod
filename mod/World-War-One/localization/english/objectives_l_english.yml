    objective_the_new_world_desc_USA:0 "The union of 1776 has managed to rise quickly to the richest economy in the world by abiding to the principle of liberalism. The USA is now the best candidate to become the next superpower, but its civil society and politicians still prefer to limit its influence to the American continent for now. To extend the American hegemony, a change of course needs to be taken, either by convincing, or by being forced to."

    objective_the_triple_entente_desc_GBR:0 "With the death of Her Majesty Queen Victoria in 1901, the Victorian era is rapidly fading into memory. The United Kingdom has made good use of the last century, solidifying an empire stretching from Johannesburg, to Cairo, to Hong Kong and Ottawa. Yet rising tensions on the old continent threaten to tear everything down. Will Britannia find herself embroiled in a new European war or sit this one out ?"

    objective_the_triple_entente_name_RUS:0 "Russian Empire"
    objective_the_triple_entente_desc_RUS:0 "Russia has been in a long agony since its defeat in 1856.

Emperor Nicholas II, is ready to push for industrialisation, but refuses any concrete political reforms, even if it contributes to its unpopularity."

    objective_the_triple_alliance_desc_GER:0 "Germany’s rise to power is threathening many, especially since the forced retirement of Bismarck in 1890. The empire managed to peacefully get new territories in Africa after the Agadir crisis of 1911, but the military command, practically a state within the state, thinks the Empire needs to truly show its army’s capabilities."
    objective_the_triple_alliance_name_AUS:0 "Austro-Hungarian Empire"
    objective_the_triple_alliance_desc_AUS:0 "The union of 1867 managed to stabilize the multiethnic empire for a while, but nationalistic tensions in the Balkans are once again causing havoc in the Empire. Competing for the region with Russia, Vienna can count on its German ally, but the danger mainly comes from inside the borders now. Can the Austro-Hungarian dynasty hold the leash of so many nationalities for so long ?"

    objective_the_two_dragons_desc_CHI:0 "The revolution of 1911 was deemed necessary to move forward and finally reform China, but now the country is highly destabilized, despite the autocratic rule of Yuan Shikai. Order must be brought quickly before the regional warlords are tempted to seize power for themselves. Recognized on the world stage, China is still snubbed and occupied by the western powers. As Japan is becoming more and more powerful and menacing, breaking diplomatic isolation is now a top priority for the new Republic."

    objective_the_two_dragons_desc_JAP:0 "Japan has managed to become the equal of western powers in terms of politics, military and economy, but remains victims of their racism. To truly be accepted, the path of militarization or democratization is necessary, maybe even both. With the unity provided by the continuous Yamamoto dynasty, the Japanese people can walk into any direction with confidence."
